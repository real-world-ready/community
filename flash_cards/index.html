      <h1><strong>CompTIA A+ Flashcards</strong></h1> 

<h2><u>Hardware:</u></h2>
 
  
      
  <dl>
    <card>
      <dt> What is a cpu and why is it important?</dt>
      <dd> The Core Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the brains of the computer. While the CPU only makes up one of many processing units, it is one of the most important. It is the part of a computer that performs calculations, actions, and runs programs</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is RAM and why is it significant?</dt>
      <dd>RAM is essentially the core of your computer. It can be considered just as important as your processor, or hard drive. ... Random access memory also helps your system support software. Every piece of software requires a minimum amount of space and memory to be able to run smoothly
</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the job of a fan/heatsink</dt>
      <dd>A heatsink and fan (HSF) is an active cooling solution used to cool down integrated circuits in computer systems, commonly the central processing unit (CPU). As the name suggests, it is composed of a passive cooling unit (the heat sink) and a fan </dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt> What is A GPU? </dt>
      <dd>TGPU computing is the use of a GPU (graphics processing unit) as a co-processor to accelerate CPUs for general-purpose scientific and engineering computing. The GPU accelerated applications running on the CPU by offloading some of the compute-intensive and time consuming portions of the code.                      
</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the fastest storage device?</dt>
      <dd>SSD is by far the fastest storage device on a computer A solid-state drive (SSD) is a new generation of storage device used in computers. SSDs replace traditional mechanical hard disks by using flash-based memory, which is significantly faster. Older hard-disk storage technologies run slower, which often makes your computer run slower than it should.  </dd>
    </card>
  </dl>
    
</br>
<h2><u>Operating system (OS) :</u></h2>

      <dl>
    <card>
      <dt>Explain the main purpose of an operating system?</dt>
      <dd>Operating systems exist for two main purposes. One is that it is designed to make sure a computer system performs well by managing its computational activities. Another is that it provides an environment for the development and execution of programs.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What are the advantages of a multiprocessor system?</dt>
      <dd>With an increased number of processors, there is a considerable increase in throughput. It can also save more money because they can share resources. Finally, overall reliability is increased as well.            </dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is SMP?</dt>
      <dd>SMP is a short form of Symmetric Multi-Processing. It is the most common type of multiple-processor system. In this system, each processor runs an identical copy of the operating system, and these copies communicate with one another as needed.  </dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is a thread?</dt>
      <dd>A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization. In general, a thread is composed of a thread ID, program counter, register set, and the stack..</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>Numerate the different RAID levels. </dt>
      <dd>RAID 0 – Non-redundant striping, RAID 1 – Mirrored Disks, RAID 2 – Memory-style error-correcting codes, RAID 3 – Bit-interleaved Parity, RAID 4 – Block-interleaved Parity, RAID 5 – Block-interleaved distributed Parity, RAID 6 – P+Q Redundancy. </dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>Why might your CPU be overheating?</dt>
      <dd>There could be an improper amount of thermal paste installed, your heatsink could be seated improperly, or there could be poor airflow due to dust buildup or poor case design.</dd>
    </card>
  </dl>

     <card>
      <dt>Which key/key combination should be pressed during system boot in Windows XP/Vista/7 to get access to the Startup Repair utility? 
</dt>
      <dd>F8.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>Which of the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) utilities would be used for manual troubleshooting of system startup issues? </dt>
      <dd>BOOTREC.EXE
</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>Common troubleshooting steps related to Windows services that fail to start include:</dt>
      <dd>Checking for warnings and errors in Windows Logs and Application and Services Logs log spaces in the Event Viewer (EVENTVWR), Starting the service manually in the Services applet (SERVICES.MSC)
</dd>
