<h2><u>Networking:</u></h2>
 
  
      
  <dl>
    <card>
      <dt>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</dt>
      <dd>TCP provides reliable and guaranteed delivery of data while UDP is faster but doesn't have any error checking or guaranteed delivery.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What are the advantages of using a switch over a hub?</dt>
      <dd>A hub forwards packets to all devices on all ports with no error checking, but a switch is able to send packets to specific devices and works more efficiently.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the difference between static and dynamic IP addressing?</dt>
      <dd>Static IP addressing allows a user to choose an IP address that never changes for a device. Dynamic IP addressing uses DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to devices as needed.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the role of a DNS server?</dt>
      <dd>The role of a DNS server is to translate IP addresses into domain names and vice versa so that it is easier for humans to access websites and such.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the role of a DHCP server?</dt>
      <dd>The role of a DHCP server is to store, send and receive information regarding IP addresses and other network parameters so that they can be dynamically assigned to devices on a network.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What does a VPN do?</dt>
      <dd>A VPN creates a secure tunnel between your device and a private server, allowing a user to mask their IP address and information they are transmitting for greater security and privacy.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is a major difference between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses?</dt>
      <dd>IPv4 addresses have 32 bits and IPv6 addresses have 128 bits. This means that there is a  relatively limited amount of IPv4 addresses. However, there are almost infinite IPv6 addresses.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What are the differences between the 802.11g and 802.11ac protocols?</dt>
      <dd>The 802.11g Wi-Fi protocol supports a 54 Mbps network speed on the 2.4 GHz band while the 802.11ac Wi-Fi protocol supports dual band with 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and up to 450 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band.</dd>
    </card>
      
       <card>
      <dt>What is a PAN?</dt>
      <dd>A PAN is a personal area network and is a term for a network that is contained in a small area close to a personâ€™s body. A PAN is made up of devices that have short range communication abilities using technologies like Bluetooth and Zigbee to connect to each other.</dd>
    </card>
  </dl>
    
</br>
<h2><u>Hardware and Network Troubleshooting:</u></h2>

      <dl>
    <card>
      <dt>What is the best practice methodology to resolve problems?</dt>
      <dd>IETEVD, or Identify the problem, Establish a theory of probable cause, Test the theory to determine cause, Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution, Verify full system functionality, and Document findings, actions, and outcomes.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is a reason that a computer might not recognize a storage device?</dt>
      <dd>The SATA power or data cable could be loose or not connected.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is a reason that the front panel hard drive or power LED might not light up?</dt>
      <dd>The case front panel connectors may be faulty, unplugged, or plugged in with the wrong polarity.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is a reason that a computer might not recognize RAM modules that have been installed?</dt>
      <dd>The RAM module may be seated improperly or may be faulty or DOA.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is a reason that your display might display ghost images?</dt>
      <dd>The display could be experiencing burn-in or it could be caused by a slow response time of the monitor.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>Why might your CPU be overheating?</dt>
      <dd>There could be an improper amount of thermal paste installed, your heatsink could be seated improperly, or there could be poor airflow due to dust buildup or poor case design.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What does it mean if your hard disk drive is making a clicking noise?</dt>
      <dd>This is often a sign that your HDD has failed catastrophically. While it is still possible to recover your data at this point, it is unlikely</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>Why would your PC shut down during intensive workloads?</dt>
      <dd>Your PC could be overheating due to the extra strain placed on it, or your power supply may not be powerful enough to handle the power requirements at high load.</dd>
    </card>
      
       <card>
      <dt>What is display burn-in?</dt>
      <dd>Display burn-in is when part of your display shows a certain permanent image or discoloration caused by hardware. This could be caused by a certain image being on your screen in the same place for a very extended period of time.</dd>
    </card>
  </dl>

</br>

<h2><u>Security:</u></h2>
<dl>

 <card>
      <dt>What is an example of authentication with something you are?</dt>
      <dd>Something you are can encompass most biometric authentication, such as your fingerprint or your iris. These can be used to authenticate yourself through things like fingerprint scanners or iris scanners.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What is an example of authentication with something you have?</dt>
      <dd>Something you have can be things like smart cards, keys or hardware tokens that can be used to authenticate yourself.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What is an example of authentication using something you know?</dt>
      <dd>Something you know could be a password or a username that can be entered into a system and checked against a database to authenticate yourself.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What is an advantage of WPA2 over WEP?</dt>
      <dd>WPA2 is much more secure than WEP and it allows you to use much stronger AES encryption instead of the TKIS encryption that WEP uses.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What is spear phishing?</dt>
      <dd>Spear phishing is when an attacker sends an email or message to a specific user, pretending to be a trustworthy person. The user would usually click on a link that would send them to a malicious site, or otherwise steal their data. Unlike phishing, spear phishing is highly targeted and usually targets an individual that is researched by the attacker.</dd>
    </card>

</dl>
    </br>
<h2><u>Mobile Devices:</u></h2>

<dl>

 <card>
      <dt>What is a port replicator?</dt>
      <dd>A port replicator is a docking device that can be connected to a laptop to allow the use of many more ports than the laptop would have normally.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What are the most common smartphone display technologies?</dt>

    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What should you do before replacing a customer replaceable component in a laptop?</dt>

    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What is the difference between customer replaceable units (CRU) and field replaceable units (FRU)?</dt>
      <dd>CRUs are components that can be easily and safely replaced by a customer such as the laptop battery, hard drive, and RAM. FRUs are components that should not be replaced by a customer, and instead should be worked on by a technician, such as the laptop display and motherboard.</dd>
    </card>
    
     <card>
      <dt>What is the difference between the walled garden system of the iOS App Store and the open platform of the Google Play Store?</dt>
      <dd>The walled garden system of the iOS App store means that Apple must approve all software that is put on the App Store and nothing is added without the permission of Apple. The open platform of the Google Play Store means that any developers can add their apps to the store and they do not need to be vetted by Google.
