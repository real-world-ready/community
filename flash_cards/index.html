  <dl>
    <card>
      <dt>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</dt>

    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What are the advantages of using a switch over a hub?</dt>
      <dd>A hub forwards packets to all devices on all ports with no error checking, but a switch is able to send packets to specific devices and works more efficiently.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the difference between static and dynamic IP addressing?</dt>
      <dd>Static IP addressing allows a user to choose an IP address that never changes for a device. Dynamic IP addressing uses DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to devices as needed.</dd>
    </card>
      
    <card>
      <dt>What is the role of a DNS server?</dt>
      <dd>The role of a DNS server is to translate IP addresses into domain names and vice versa so that it is easier for humans to access websites and such.</dd>

    <card>
      <dt>What is the role of a DHCP server?</dt>
      <dd>The role of a DHCP server is to store, send and receive information regarding IP addresses and other network parameters so that they can be dynamically assigned to devices on a network.</dd>
