      <dt>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</dt>
      <dd part="Network Technology">While TCP and UDP are both on the transport layer, TCP is a protocol that provides reliable and guaranteed delivery of data while UDP is faster but does not have any error checking features or guaranteed delivery.</dd>

    <card>
        <dt>What are the advantages of using a switch over a hub?</dt>
        <dd part="Network Technology">A hub forwards packets to all devices on all ports with no error checking, but a switch is able to send packets to specific devices and works more efficiently. A switch also has error checking to avoid sending undesirable packets.</dd>
    </card>
    <card>
        <dt>What is the difference between static and dynamic IP addressing?</dt>
        <dd part="Network Technology">Static IP addressing allows a user to choose an IP address that never changes for a device. Dynamic IP addressing uses DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to devices as needed.</dd>
